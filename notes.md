The Kermode bear, sometimes called the spirit bear (Ursus americanus kermodei), is a subspecies of the American black bear and lives in the Central and North Coast regions of British Columbia, Canada.[2] It is the official provincial mammal of British Columbia and symbol of Terrace, British Columbia.[3][4] While most Kermode bears are black, between 100 and 500 fully white individuals exist.[5] The white variant is known as spirit bear, and is most common on three islands in British Columbia (Gribbell, Princess Royal, and Roderick), where they make up 10-20% of the Kermode population.[6] Spirit bears hold a prominent place in the oral traditions of the indigenous peoples of the area. They have also been featured in a National Geographic documentary.[7] - Wikipedia
